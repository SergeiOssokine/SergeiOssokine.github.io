ABSTRACT = {The European climate is changing displaying profound impacts on agriculture, thus strongly reaching the scientific community&rsquo;s attention. In this review, the compilation of selected scientific research on the agroclimatic conditions&rsquo; changes and their impact on the productivity parameters (phenology timing, product quality and quantity) of grapevines and on the spatiotemporal characteristics of the viticultural areas are attempted for the first time. For this purpose, a thorough investigation through multiple search queries was conducted for the period (2005&ndash;2021). Overall, increasing (decreasing) trends in critical temperature (precipitation) parameters are the reality of the recent past with visible impacts on viticulture. The observed climate warming already enforces emerging phenomena related to the modification of the developmental rate (earlier phenological events, shortening of phenological intervals, lengthening of the growing season, earlier harvest), the alteration of product quality, the heterogeneous effects on grapevine yield and the emergence of new cool-climate viticulture areas highlighting the cultivation&rsquo;s rebirth in the northern and central parts of the continent. The vulnerability of the wine-growing ecosystem urges the integration of innovative and sustainable solutions for confronting the impacts of climate change and safeguarding the production (quantity and quality) capacity of viticultural systems in Europe under a continuously changing environment.},

  abstract  = {A long-term (1952-1997) climatology was developed using reference vineyard observations in Bordeaux, France. The procedure partitioned the season into growth intervals from one phenological event to the next (budburst, floraison, veraison, and harvest) in which climatic influences were summed and assessed. The data were then used to investigate the relationships between climate and phenology, berry composition at harvest, total production, and quality. Over the last two decades, the phenology of grapevines in Bordeaux has tended towards earlier phenological events, a shortening of phenological intervals, and a lengthening of the growing season. Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon varieties have tended to produce higher sugar to total acid ratios, greater berry weights, and greater potential wine quality. Vintage ratings have shown a general increase over the last two decades paralleling the observed phenology and composition trends. The composition and quality trends were mostly described by increases in the number of warm days during floraison and veraison and a reduction in precipitation during maturation. Production variability was not as readily described by phenological-interval climate parameters, but regression modeling did indicate that rainfall during physiologically important periods (flowering and maturation) tended to decrease crop production. By variety, the relationships between phenology, climate, and composition were typically higher (both positive and negative) for Merlot than for Cabernet Sauvignon and could be an indication that, in Bordeaux, Merlot is more phenologically and climatologically sensitive. Additionally, sugar to acid ratios revealed that both Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon composition influenced Bordeaux wine quality, although variations in Cabernet Sauvignon described substantially more of the variability in ratings. This indicates that the wine industry in Bordeaux is more dependent Cabernet Sauvignon for good vintages than on Merlot.},

  abstract = {This study concerns firstly the methodology to describe the climate of vineyards, on a macroclimate scale of viticultural regions worldwide. Three synthetic and complementary viticultural climatic indices (potential water balance of the soil over the growing cycle, heliothermal conditions over the growing cycle and night temperature during maturation), validated as descriptors, are used: (1) dryness index (DI) which corresponds to the potential water balance of the soil of Riou’s index, here adapted using precise conditions to calculate it, as an indicator of the level of presence-absence of dryness; (2) heliothermal index (HI) which corresponds to Huglin’s heliothermal index; (3) cool night index (CI) an index developed as an indicator of night temperature conditions during maturation. These indices are representative of the variability of the viticultural climate worldwide, related to the requirements of varieties, vintage quality (sugar, colour, aroma), and typeness of the wines. A Multicriteria Climatic Classification System (Géoviticulture MCC System) for the grape-growing regions worldwide is formulated based on classes for each of the three climate indices, with elements to explain the results. Three formulated concepts provide the system base: viticultural climate, climatic group and viticultural climate with intra-annual variability (for warm regions with more than one harvest a year in natural climate conditions). The application of the Géoviticulture Multicriteria Climatic Classification System is presented for 97 grape-growing regions in 29 countries. The system is a research tool for grape-growing and wine-making zoning. It also enables work at different levels on the scale, on a world-wide scale or larger – the large grape-growing region, the small grape-growing region, as shown by the studies performed. It allows relating the viticultural climate to the elements of grape quality and the typeness of the wines considering the climatic zone.},

  abstract = {Background and Aims: Temperature-based indices are commonly used to indicate long-term suitabil-
ity of climate for commercially viable winegrape production of different grapevine cultivars, but their
calculation has been inconsistent and often inconsiderate of within-region spatial variability. This paper
(i) investigates and quantifies differences between four such indices; and (ii) quantifies the within-region
spatial variability for each Australian wine region.
Methods and Results: Four commonly used indices describing winegrape growing suitability were
calculated for each Australian geographic indication (GI) using temperature data from 1971 to 2000.
Within-region spatial variability was determined for each index using a geographic information system.
The sets of indices were compared with each other using first- and second-order polynomial regression.
Heat-sum temperature indices were strongly related to the simple measure of mean growing season
temperature, but variation resulted in some differences between indices.
Conclusion: Temperature regime differences between the same region pairs varied depending upon
which index was employed. Spatial variability of the climate indices within some regions led to significant
overlap with other regions; knowledge of the climate distribution provides a better understanding of the
range of cultivar suitability within each region.
Significance of the Study: Within-region spatial variability and the use of different indices over
inconsistent time periods to describe temperature regimes have, before now, made comparisons of
climates between viticulture regions difficult. Consistent calculations of indices, and quantification of
spatial variability, enabled comparisons of Australian GIs to be made both within Australia and with
American Viticultural Areas in the western United States.},

abstract = {We elucidate grapevine evolution and domestication histories with 3525 cultivated and wild accessions worldwide. In the Pleistocene, harsh climate drove the separation of wild grape ecotypes caused by continuous habitat fragmentation. Then, domestication occurred concurrently about 11,000 years ago in Western Asia and the Caucasus to yield table and wine grapevines. The Western Asia domesticates dispersed into Europe with early farmers, introgressed with ancient wild western ecotypes, and subsequently diversified along human migration trails into muscat and unique western wine grape ancestries by the late Neolithic. Analyses of domestication traits also reveal new insights into selection for berry palatability, hermaphroditism, muscat flavor, and berry skin color. These data demonstrate the role of the grapevines in the early inception of agriculture across Eurasia.},
