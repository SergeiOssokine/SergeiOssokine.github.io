ABSTRACT = {Many books, textbooks and papers have been published in which the classification of map projections is based on auxiliary (developable) surfaces and projections are divided into conic, cylindrical and azimuthal projections. We argue that such a classification of map projections is unacceptable and give many reasons for that. Many authors wrote in more detail about the classification of map projections, and our intention is to give a new refined and rectified insight into the classification of map projections. Our approach can be included in map projection publications of general and thematic cartography. Doing this, misconceptions and unnecessary insistence on conceptuality instead of reality will be avoided.},
