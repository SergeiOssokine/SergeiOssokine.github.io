# Introduction
Cartography - the science of map-making - has been an essential tool for human exploration and understanding for millennia. From ancient Babylonian clay tablets to Ptolemy's "Geography" to Polynesian Stick Charts (and so many [others](https://press.uchicago.edu/books/HOC/index.html)), we've always grappled with the challenge of representing our world. As the years drew on, we developed  various map projections to represent the curved Earth on a flat surface, although each projection had its own strengths and distortions, which reflect the historical context of the times. With time, navigation became ever more crucial for trade, empire-building and war, and cartography evolved as well, reflecting advancements in mathematics, astronomy, and geodesy.

In our modern globalized world, cartography has taken on new dimensions of importance. Digital mapping technologies, powered by satellite imagery and GPS, have revolutionized how we navigate and understand our planet. Cartography is all around us: from the ubiquitous smartphone maps guiding our daily commutes, to the sophisticated GIS systems informing urban planning and climate science. As we continue to explore our home planet, the solar system, and beyond, mathematical cartography will remain an indispensable tool, helping us to visualize and understand new worlds.

But let's return to the Earth for the time being. Representing spatial information accurately on the surface of the Earth requires a good mathematical model. In this blog post, let's examine some basics of modelling the Earth surface, as well as the problem of mapping information from the curved Earth surface to a flat map at a high level.

# Spherical and Ellipsoidal Earth  {#sec-earthmodel}
The simplest mathematical model of the Earth is a sphere. The widely known latitude and longitude furnish standard angular coordinates for the surface, which can be expressed parametrically using the usual expression in Cartesian coordinates [^1]:

$$
\begin{align}
x &= R\cos\phi\cos\theta \\
y &= R\sin\phi\cos\theta \\
z &= R\sin\theta
\end{align}
$$


While the spherical model is remarkably good, modern applications require a more accurate representation. The most important effect to take into account is the (very slight) bulging out of the surface close to the equator, caused by Earth's rotation.  An appropriate model for this is a ellipsoid of revolution (aka a oblate spheroid) which is created by rotating an ellipse around its semi-minor axis (which we take to be the $z$ axis). Since we have azimuthal symmetry, it's easier to examine the properties and parametrization of the spheroid by considering an arbitrary cross-section. Without loss of generality, we work in the $x-z$ plane.

In Cartesian coordinates, the ellipse is given by

$$ \frac{x^2}{a^2}+\frac{z^2}{b^2} = 1 $$


The following table summarizes some popular parameterizations. For construction/derivation see @sec-parametrizations

z &= \frac{b^{2}}{a^2}N(\phi)\sin\phi
\end{align}
$$
:::
::::


To parametrize the ellipsoid, we just need to rotate the ellipse around the $z$ axis and pay attention to limits of the angles.
Defining the usual azimuthal angle by $\lambda$ for the geodetic parametrization we get

$$ (x,y,z) = (N(\phi)\cos\phi\cos\lambda,N(\phi)\cos\phi\sin\lambda,\frac{b^2}{a^2}N(\phi)\sin\phi) $$

with $\lambda \in (0,2\pi)$ and $\phi \in (-\pi/2,\pi/2)$.



An important parameter while frequently encountered in describing ellipsoid is the _flattening_ which is equal to

$$ f = 1-\frac{b}{a} $$

It describes the degree of "squashing" of the spheroid - the deviation of being a perfect sphere. Remarkably, for the Earth this flattening is extremely small ($\sim 1/298.26$) [^2], corresponding to a difference of just $\sim 21$ km between the polar and equatorial axes.





## Building Geographic Coordinate Systems (GCS): geoid, datum and friends



### The geoid
The actual shape of the Earth is extremely complex and can only be determined via measurement.  Indeed, the complicated surface topology of the land masses is very difficult to model mathematically. Instead, one can define some reference surfaces.

A particularly important surface is the _geoid_ which is defined as the shape the Earth's oceans would take under the influence of gravity and centrifugal forces, if we turned off all other interactions like tides and currents (and its imaginary extension under the continents). In such a case, the surface of the oceans would be an equipotential surface of the potential (expressed in the co-rotating frame)[@barthelm2013]:

$$ W = W_{a}+\Phi_{c}$$

where $W_{a}(\vec{r})\equiv G\int_{v}\frac{\rho(\vec{r'})}{|\vec{r}-\vec{r'}|}dV$ is the Newtonian gravitational potential and $\Phi_{c}\equiv \frac{1}{2}\Omega^{2}d_{z}^{2}$ is the centrifugal potential.  That is, the geoid is defined as a particular $W = \rm{const}$ surface.

It should be noted that the geoid is a very complicated surface as the potential $W$ depends on the non-uniform mass density distribution inside the Earth.   The measurement of the Earth's potential has been carried out by multiple satellite missions and variations have now been mapped to very small scales. Below is an example of  geoid undulations from the XGM2019e model[@Zingerle2020] as measured with respect to a reference ellipsoidal model of the Earth (undulations have been exaggerated be a factor of 10000):

### The geodetic datum
This is perhaps the most crucial concept of all: the geodetic datum provides a reference system for representing the locations on the Earth surface[^3].
Given the complex shape of the geoid, it is hard to use it directly to construct a useful reference coordinate system to represent locations on the Earth. Thus we usually seek an ellipsoidal model on which to base our coordinate system. This model can be determined by 2 parameters, for example the semi-major axis and the flattening.  Given this model, a natural question is how to align[^4] it to "best" represent the geoid. One obvious choice is to align the ellipsoid so that it approximates the shape of the geoid in the least-squares sense for the entire globe, forming a so called _geocentric_ datum. A very widely used example of this is the WGS84 datum, which is the standard datum used in most GPS systems. Another possibility is to try to approximate the geoid as well as possible in particular region, such that the deviations from the geoid surface are minimized there. Such datums are known as _local_ datums. For example, the NAD27 (North American Datum of 1927) datum is particularly well suited for representing the US but is less well suited for Europe.

Given an ellipsoidal we can construct the geodetic coordinates on it, as described in @sec-earthmodel. Of course, one still actually needs to determine  the geodetic coordinates of different locations on the surface of Earth. Since this may be difficult to do directly everywhere (e.g. exactly at the point where you are standing with your cellphone), it is usually done in two steps. First one constructs a network of physical stations equipped with high quality GPS/GNSS receivers which allows  a precise measurement of their position in our desired coordinate system. Then given any new location on the surface of the Earth, one uses these stations as references via so-called differential positioning, which allows centimeter-level accuracy.



Note that since a datum is a _reference_ surface  that determines the geographic coordinate system, it is important to always keep in mind which datum is being used, especially when combining data from different sources.


# Maps: from Earth to paper

## Background
One of the most famous results in classical differential geometry due to Carl Friedrich Gauss is the _Theorema Egregium_ (remarkable theorem) which states that Gaussian curvature of a given surface (a certain measure of curvature) can be determined by measurements _intrinsic_ to the surface, without any reference to how it is embedded in ambient space.  The connection the mapping problem is the following: a sphere (or an ellipsoid) has non-zero Gaussian curvature while a flat piece of paper has vanishing Gaussian curvature. Thus it follows that a piece of paper cannot be folded into a sphere or conversely that a surface of a sphere cannot be unfolded onto a flat piece of paper without distortion. We therefore should expect that there is no way to construct a flat map that reproduces the information on the surface of the Earth without some distortion.

One approach that is very frequently presented when developing projections is by the use of the so-called developable surfaces. For our purposes here, a _developable_ surface is simply a surface that has zero Gaussian curvature and thus can be unrolled into a flat plane without bending (i.e. without distortions). In 3D, there are only a few such surfaces which are of use: cylinders, cones and (trivially) planes. The idea is then to project the surface of the Earth onto the developable surface and then to unroll that surface into a flat map.

Based on the type of developable surface one can classify many projections[^5]:



|            | Normal      | Transverse         | Oblique             |
|------------|--------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| **Azimuthal**  |  ![](./azimuthal_normal.png){width=200px}             |   ![](./azimuthal_transverse.png){width=200px}               | ![](./azimuthal_oblique.png){width=200px}                 |
| **Cylindrical**|  ![](./cylindrical_normal.png){width=200px}             |   ![](./cylindrical_transverse.png){width=200px}               | ![](./cylindrical_oblique.png){width=200px}                 |
| **Conical**    |  ![](./conical_normal.png){width=200px}            |   ![](./conical_transverse.png){width=200px}               | ![](./conical_oblique.png){width=200px}                 |
In the above we only considered the cases where the developable surfaces touch the sphere. One can also consider _secant_ variations where the developable surfaces intersect the sphere in multiple locations. This is demonstrated for the case of the conical map in the following video:


{{< video https://youtu.be/VyNd4fLsPwo >}}


Note that there are many modern projections which cannot be classified in any of the above categories. For this and other reasons some authors have criticized this classical classification scheme[@geographies2020019]. Indeed, _modern_ projections do not need developable surfaces to be defined and are derived by considering desirable properties of the mapping.

### To be continued
In the next post we will present a modern way of classifying and deriving projections, based on the notion of certain desirable properties (such as preserving angles) and derive a couple of famous projections from scratch.  Stay tuned!









# Appendix

## Ellipse parametrizations {#sec-parametrizations}

### Standard (aka de la Hire)
A simple parametrization in terms of angles is given by $(a\cos t,a\sin t)$. Note, however, that here $t$ is **not** the angle between the semi-major axis and the point on the spheroid (see figure below). Indeed, the construction is done as follows:

* Draw 2 circles centered at (0,0) with radii $a$ and $b$
* Given any point $P$ on the ellipse draw a vertical line from $P$ until it intersects the larger circle with radius $a$ and a horizontal line that intersects with circle of radius $b$. Note that there is a unique line from the origin that passes through both intersection points.
* The angle between the semi-major axis and this line is denoted $t$. From trigonometric considerations it follows immediately that the Cartesian coordinates of $P$ are indeed  $(a\cos t,a\sin t)$

### Polar
Another simple parametrization is the polar one, given by $(r(\theta)\cos\theta,r(\theta)\sin\theta)$. To find $r(\theta)$, note that the point must lie on the ellipse and thus:

$$ \frac{r^2\cos^2\theta}{a^2} + \frac{r^2\sin^2\theta}{b^2} = 1 $$
From which it follows that

$$ r(\theta) = \frac{ab}{\sqrt{b^2\cos^2\theta+a^2\sin^2\theta}} $$

### Geodetic

Finally, for GIS applications a particularly important parametrization is one involving the so-called geodetic latitude ($\phi$) which is the angle between the semi-major axis and the normal to the ellipse. Note that unlike the case of a circle, the normal does _not_ generally pass through the center of the ellipse. To derive this parametrization  we will proceed as follows. Consider the normal to the ellipse at some point $P=(x_0,z_0)$.  Let $f(x,z)=\frac{x^2}{a^2}+\frac{z^2}{b^2}$. Then the ellipse is the level set of $f$, given by $f(x,z)=1$. A well known result is that the gradient of the function is normal to the level sets [^6]. Thus $\nabla f$ is a vector in the direction of the normal. We have

$$ \nabla f = (f_x,f_z) =  \left(\frac{2x}{a^2},\frac{2z}{b^2}\right) $$

From trigonometry we have that

$$ \tan\phi = \frac{f_z}{f_x}\rvert_{(x_0,z_0)} = \frac{a^2}{b^2}\frac{z_0}{x_0} $$

which implies that $z_0^2 = \frac{b^4}{a^4}x_0^2\tan^2\phi$. Since $P$ lies on the ellipse we also have that

$$ b^2 x_0^2 + a^2 z_0^2 = a^2 b^2$$

Substituting we get that

$$ x_0^{2} = \frac{a^{4}}{a^2+b^2\tan\phi} = \frac{a^4\cos^2\phi}{a^2\cos^2\phi+b^2\sin^2\phi} $$

which means

$$ x_0 =  \frac{a^2}{\sqrt{a^2\cos^2\phi+b^2\sin^2\phi}}\cos\phi  := N(\phi)\cos\phi $$

(Note that we took the positive root since we want $x\geq 0$  for $\phi\in[0,\pi/2]$ )

Substituting this result back and solving for $z_0$ we get

$$ z_0 = \frac{b^2}{a^2}N(\phi)\sin\phi$$

Thus we finally have that the parametrization of the ellipse is given by

$$ \left(N(\phi)\cos\phi,\frac{b^2}{a^2}N(\phi)\sin\phi\right) $$

One can easily check that:

* The coordinates do indeed describe an ellipse
* One gets the expected coordinates for $\phi=0$ and $\phi=\pi/2$.

[^1]: In principle this is not quite  correct - there is no single coordinate chart that can cover the whole sphere. Indeed the polar coordinates do not cover the poles (the intervals for the angles must be _open_). See e.g. Example 4.1.4 in  [@leesmooth].
[^2]: The data can be found in many sources, e.g. In Table 1.1. of [this report](https://www.iers.org/IERS/EN/Publications/TechnicalNotes/tn36.html)
[^3]: Note that the actual process of constructing a geodetic datum and the practical implementation of the resulting coordinate system are extremely complicated. Below we omit a lot of detail, including the temporal aspects, corrections due to various effects like tides and many others.
[^4]: Here by aligning we mean choosing the center of the ellipsoid as well as the orientation of its axes. Note that for local datums, we may choose a particular point where the reference ellipsoid is tangent to the geoid, and this, along with the orientation implicitly defines the location of its center.
