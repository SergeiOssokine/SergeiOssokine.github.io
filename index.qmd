### About Me

I recently transitioned from academia, where I specialized in modelling signals from compact object binaries (mostly black holes, but sometimes neutron stars and [even more exotic things](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.06959)). For 7 years I was part of the LIGO collaboration, working on understanding gravitational wave events with scientists around the globe. Now, I apply the same skills to many diverse problems in data science.
